# Cross-Media Recommendation System for Enhanced Social Connections

## Executive Summary
We propose developing a cross-media recommendation system to connect users based on shared media interests. Utilizing a Siamese neural network architecture, the system will interpret user preferences across various media types by leveraging latent representations derived from user reviews and media embeddings. This approach aims to enhance social connections by accurately predicting user ratings and recommending media that align with individual tastes, thereby improving the efficiency of discovering and engaging with content that resonates with users' artistic and entertainment preferences.

## Project Description
Connecting individuals with similar media interests across different platforms can significantly enhance social interactions and content discovery. Traditional recommendation systems often operate within a single media domain, limiting their ability to provide holistic recommendations. This project leverages a cross-media recommendation approach, employing a Siamese neural network to model the relationships between users and diverse media types such as movies, books, and music. By integrating user reviews and ratings, the system will generate latent representations that capture nuanced user preferences, enabling accurate predictions of media ratings and effective recommendations that transcend individual media categories.

## Goals
1. **Primary Goal**: Develop a Siamese neural network-based recommendation model capable of predicting user ratings and recommending media across multiple domains by interpreting latent user and media embeddings.
2. **Secondary Goal**: Enhance user engagement and satisfaction by providing personalized, cross-media recommendations that reflect comprehensive user preferences.
3. **Tertiary Goal**: Establish a scalable framework that can be extended with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to continuously refine recommendation accuracy based on user interactions and feedback.

## Data Collection
- **Source**: 
  - **User Reviews and Ratings**: Collect data from platforms such as IMDb for movies, Goodreads for books, and Spotify for music.
  - **APIs and Public Datasets**: Utilize APIs like the IMDb API, Goodreads API, and Spotify Web API to gather user reviews, ratings, and media metadata.
- **Features**:
  - **User Data**: User IDs, demographic information (if available), and historical ratings across different media types.
  - **Media Data**: Media IDs, genres, metadata (e.g., director, author, artist), and content-specific features.
  - **Textual Data**: User reviews providing insights into user preferences and sentiments.
- **Human Feedback (Future Work)**: Collect explicit user feedback on recommendations to enable future enhancements using RLHF.

## Data Cleaning
- **Standardization**: Normalize ratings to a common scale and ensure consistency in media metadata across different sources.
- **Error Handling**: Remove incomplete or corrupted entries, handle missing values, and ensure the integrity of user and media data.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize user reviews, remove stopwords, and perform stemming or lemmatization to prepare textual data for embedding generation.
- **Data Augmentation**: Implement techniques such as synonym replacement in reviews to increase variability and improve model robustness.

## Feature Extraction
- **User and Media Embeddings**: Generate dense vector representations for users and media items using pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT) for textual data from reviews and metadata.
- **Latent Representations**: Develop latent vectors that capture the essence of user preferences and media attributes, facilitating the comparison and recommendation process.
- **Sequence Preparation**: Organize data into pairs of user and media embeddings along with corresponding ratings to train the Siamese network effectively.

## Modelling
- **Model Architecture**: 
  - **Siamese Neural Network**: Implement a Siamese network that processes user and media embeddings through twin subnetworks, merging them to predict the probability of a user rating a media item.
  - **Integration of Reviews**: Incorporate textual data from user reviews to enhance the richness of embeddings and improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Training Approach**:
  - **Supervised Learning**: Train the network using pairs of user-media embeddings with known ratings to learn the underlying preference patterns.
  - **Reinforcement Learning (Future Work)**: Apply RLHF to fine-tune the model based on user interactions and feedback, enhancing its ability to align recommendations with evolving user preferences.
- **Optimization**: Utilize the AdamW optimizer with appropriate learning rate scheduling to ensure efficient training and convergence, while mitigating overfitting through regularization techniques.

## Visualization
- **Embedding Space Analysis**: Use t-SNE or PCA to visualize the distribution of user and media embeddings, highlighting clusters of similar preferences and media attributes.
- **Model Performance Visualization**: Plot training and validation loss curves to monitor model convergence and identify potential overfitting or underfitting.
- **Recommendation Insights**: Create dashboards displaying recommended media for users, along with similarity scores and key features driving the recommendations.

We propose that the most effective way to understand model performance is through both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments, including user feedback and auditory reviews of recommended media where applicable.

## Test Plan / Metrics
- **Data Split**: 
  - **Training**: 70%
  - **Validation**: 15%
  - **Testing**: 15%
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Validation Loss**: Monitor cross-entropy loss to assess the model's predictive accuracy during training.
  - **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Measure the difference between predicted and actual ratings to evaluate prediction precision.
  - **Precision@K and Recall@K**: Assess the relevance of the top-K recommendations provided to users.
  - **Musical Coherence**: Conduct qualitative evaluations with domain experts to assess the relevance and quality of media recommendations.
  - **RLHF Metrics (Future Steps)**: Track user feedback scores and reward signals to evaluate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning fine-tuning.

## Conclusion
This project aims to create a technically robust cross-media recommendation system using a Siamese neural network architecture. By leveraging latent representations derived from user reviews and media embeddings, the system will provide accurate and personalized recommendations across various media types. The structured approach ensures that the project remains focused and achievable within a short timeline, while laying the groundwork for future enhancements through reinforcement learning and continuous user feedback integration. The successful implementation of this system will improve the efficiency of media discovery and foster enhanced social connections based on shared interests.
